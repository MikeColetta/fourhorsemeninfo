## Project Description

Built an informational website for Four Horsemen. They're business includes a brewery, food truck, and concessions business. The goal of the site was to showcase each aspect of the business, tell their story, and introduce you to the team. 

I started with the [agency template from startbootstrap.com](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/agency). I deleted some of the unwanted sections and will later go on to improve my own. I want to create my own custom section for all of the beers currently on tap and the menu at the racetrack.
